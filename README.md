driving using behavioral cloning

teaching a neural net to drive using a simulator

end-to-end driving is a scam

check it out [in action!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vgAdaLyWEQ)

[![demo video](resources/demo.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vgAdaLyWEQ)

i'll post a higher-quality video eventually

writeup coming soon. in the meantime, check out [this paper from nvidia](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) and the [project/paper from comma.ai](https://github.com/commaai/research)

dependencies
---
 - keras w/ tensorflow backend
 - numpy
 - scipy
 - [udacity's simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim)

 how to use
 ---
	0. Check out this [README](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3)
  1. Train a model
	2. Save model into .h5 file
	3. Run the simulator in auto mode
	4. run ```python drive.py model.h5```
	5. enjoy!
